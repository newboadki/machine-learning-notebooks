    "## Definition <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"1_1\"></a>\n",
    "Attention is a mechanism that let's the model focus on specific parts of the input sequence when generating the next output. More concretely, since we are training a model, attention will help the model focus on the most relevant parts (according to the problem at hand) of the input when generating the next outpput.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention is not exlcusive to _seq2seq_ models, neither is it to _NLP_. The rest of the document will focus on _NLP_ applications though.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"1_2\"></a>\n",
    "The attention mechanism was designed to address the information bottleneck problem suffered by _seq2seq_ models , particularly, with long input sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original _seq2seq_ networks with an encoder-decoder architecture, the encoder would only pass the last step's hidden state vector to the decoder. This means that a single hidden vector was used to encode every other hidden vector from previous steps. This resulted in low performarce as the size of the input sequences increased.\n",
